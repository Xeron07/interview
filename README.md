**Technical Interview**

**Coding:**

**Array of strings :** const **words** = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig"];

**Array of numbers :** const **numbers** = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];\*\*

1. Given an array of numbers (**_numbers_**), filter out all the even numbers
2. Given an array of strings (**_words_**), capitalize the first letter of each string
3. Given an array of numbers (**_numbers_**), check if any of the numbers are greater than 10.
4. Given an array of strings (**_words_**), concatenate them into a single string using **_reduce_** function
5. You have an array of numbers, and you need to find a specific element within the array. Write a function that searches for the element and returns its index if found or -1 if it's not in the array.

   **Array:** const numbers = [8, 2, 10, 5, 3, 7, 1, 4, 9];
   **Target:** const targetElement = 7;

6. Can you use binary seach for the previous question array?
